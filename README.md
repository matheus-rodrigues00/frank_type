# Frank Type

Frank Type is a Rails 8 typing trainer for practicing on normalized public-domain prose instead of random word lists. It is built for local-first, no-account use: session history, timing data, and profile charts stay in the browser's local storage.

## Run with Docker

Docker is the easiest way to run Frank Type. The image is published as `akitaonrails/frank_type` and runs Rails through Thruster on container port `80`.

### Option 1: run the published image

Fast launcher from GitHub:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/akitaonrails/frank_type/master/bin/docker-run.sh | bash
```

It defaults to <http://localhost:3200>. Override values when needed:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/akitaonrails/frank_type/master/bin/docker-run.sh | PORT=8080 HOST=localhost bash
```

Manual equivalent:

```bash
docker run --rm \
  -p 3200:80 \
  -e RAILS_ENV=production \
  -e SECRET_KEY_BASE=development-only-secret-key-base-change-me-development-only-secret-key-base \
  -e HOST=localhost \
  -e FORCE_SSL=false \
  -e ASSUME_SSL=false \
  akitaonrails/frank_type:latest
```

Open <http://localhost:3200>.

### Option 2: run from this repository

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

Open <http://localhost:3200>.

### Production Docker Compose

1. Copy `docker-compose.prod.yml` and a real `.env.production` to the server.
2. Put a TLS reverse proxy in front of `127.0.0.1:3200`.
3. Run:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml pull
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
```

Production env template:

```bash
cp .env.production.example .env.production
bin/rails secret # use this value for SECRET_KEY_BASE
```

For a real public deployment, keep `FORCE_SSL=true`, `ASSUME_SSL=true`, and set `HOST` to the public host name served by your reverse proxy.

### Build and publish to Docker Hub

Manual publish requires `docker login` and Buildx:

```bash
bin/docker-publish
```

Defaults:

- image: `akitaonrails/frank_type`
- tags: `latest` and the current git short SHA
- platforms: `linux/amd64,linux/arm64`

Override when needed:

```bash
IMAGE=yourname/frank_type VERSION_TAG=v1.0.0 PLATFORMS=linux/amd64 bin/docker-publish
```

GitHub Actions also publishes on pushes to `master`, tags matching `v*`, and manual workflow dispatch. Configure repository secrets `DOCKERHUB_USERNAME` and `DOCKERHUB_TOKEN`.

## Highlights

- Rails-rendered UI with Hotwire, Stimulus, Importmap, and Tailwind CSS.
- Public-domain corpus organized for multiple languages: `config/excerpts/<language>/<category>/<speed>.yml`.
- English and Brazilian Portuguese corpus categories: `scifi`, `fantasy`, and `biography`.
- Brazilian Portuguese practice preserves accents/diacritics and is intended to train US-layout dead keys, Option accents, and other composed accent entry.
- Locale-aware UI and corpus loading; normal requests load only the selected language.
- Theme switcher with a preserved Slate theme and a logo-derived Rush palette.
- Adaptive excerpt choice based on recent local WPM:
  - `slow`: sub-60 WPM
  - `medium`: roughly 75–139 WPM
  - `fast`: 140+ WPM
- Category toggle with random fallback.
- Timed sessions: 15s, 30s, and 60s.
- Accurate browser-side key timing via `performance.now()`.
- Per-session metrics: WPM, raw WPM, accuracy, mistakes, character timings, word timings, key events, and digraph timings.
- Post-run digraph heat map: slow adjacent character pairs are highlighted after the timer ends.
- Typeracer-style race strip with simulated slower/faster competitors.
- Local profile page with WPM and accuracy trends; older detailed runs compact into daily summaries to keep browser storage bounded.
- Docker-first local run, Docker Hub publishing, and production Compose deployment.

## Keyboard controls

| Key | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `?` | Open shortcut help |
| `Esc` | Restart current run; closes help if help is open |
| `Tab` | Load a random compatible excerpt |

## Development without Docker

```bash
bin/setup
bin/dev
```

Open <http://localhost:3000>.

## Tests

```bash
bin/rails test
npm test
bin/rails tailwindcss:build
```

`bin/ci` also runs RuboCop, Brakeman, bundler-audit, importmap audit, and SimpleCov-backed Rails tests.

## Corpus notes

Project Gutenberg is the canonical source. Do not scrape its human-facing pages. Future importers should use official feeds, robot harvest URLs, rsync mirrors, or Gutendex metadata, then store title, author, ebook id, source URL, copyright flag, and attribution with every excerpt.

Current English excerpts include public-domain Asimov stories available on Gutenberg plus AI/automation-adjacent classics such as _R.U.R._, _Metropolis_, and _The Machine Stops_. Famous Asimov works such as _Foundation_ and _I, Robot_ are not public-domain Gutenberg texts.

Current Brazilian Portuguese excerpts use public-domain Gutenberg texts from Machado de Assis, José de Alencar, Joaquim Nabuco, Visconde de Taunay, and Coelho Netto. Excerpts may modernize obsolete spellings for contemporary typing practice while preserving attribution to the source text.

Target corpus size is at least 10 vetted excerpts per language/category/speed band.

</p>

### Locales

- Add UI strings under `config/locales/<locale>.yml`.
- Add excerpts under `config/excerpts/<locale>/<category>/<speed>.yml`.
- Keep the current category/speed structure unless the app UI and tests are updated too.
- Cite public-domain source metadata for every excerpt.
- Locale selection order is query parameter, cookie, browser `Accept-Language`, then English fallback.

### Themes

- Theme tokens live in `app/assets/tailwind/application.css` as CSS variables keyed by `data-theme` on `<html>`.
- Add new theme choices in `app/views/layouts/application.html.erb` and translations under `app.theme`.
- Keep body text contrast at WCAG AA levels (`4.5:1` for normal text). Accent, focus, border, chart, and heat-map colors should be defined through variables, not hard-coded in views or JavaScript.
- Theme preference is stored locally in the browser as `frankType.theme`; no server-side user storage exists.
- Typing history is also browser-local. Recent sessions keep detailed timing data; older sessions are compacted into weighted daily summaries for graphs.
